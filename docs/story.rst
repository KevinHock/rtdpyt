The Story
==========================

PyT was created by Bruno and Stefan, as their Master's `Thesis`_.

Almost a year later, Kevin was talking about :ref:`foo` with a friend, the friend asked for resources for learning more about taint tracking, found PyT in the process, gave up on :ref:`foo` and has been contributing since.

A couple of months after that Collin released Focuson, we then started to publicize PyT to the Python and InfoSec communities.
