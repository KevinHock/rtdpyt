The Story
==========================

PyT was created by Bruno and Stefan, as their `Master\'s Thesis`_.

Almost a year later, Kevin was talking about `JunkHacker`_ with a friend, the friend asked for resources for learning more about taint tracking, while looking he found the PyT thesis, gave up on `JunkHacker`_ and has been contributing since.

A couple of months after that Collin released `Focuson`_, we then started to publicize PyT to the Python and InfoSec communities.
