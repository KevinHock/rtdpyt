We try to be pretty flexible with who we allow on the development team.
The best path is to send a few pull requests,
and follow up to make sure they get merged successfully.
You can check out our :doc:`contribute` to get more information,
and find issues that need to be addressed.
After that,
feel free to ask for a commit bit.
