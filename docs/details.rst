How It Works
==========================

* What is an AST?

* What is reaching definitions?

* What is liveness analysis?

* What does fixed point mean?

* How does fixpointmethod affect constraint table?

* What is a lattice?
	A lattice is just a partially ordered set that sounds fancy and looks pretty in papers.

* What design patterns are used in the PyT codebase?
	The template pattern is used when deciding what analysis to use
	The visitor pattern is used when visiting the different nodes of the AST.
